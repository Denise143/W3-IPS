# The project was about helping MTN Cote D'ivoire upgrade their techbology infrastructure, They wanted an analysis of the cities which their product were used most so as to know how to go about it. They also wanted to know which one of their products is extensively used. Using python pandas for analysis, I was able to find out all their concerns and recommend some ways they woulsd start upgrading their infrastructure.
